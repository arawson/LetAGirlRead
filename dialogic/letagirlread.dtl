It's the end of the semester.
No more finals.
Time to rest and recuperate for the next semester.

player (default): (Finals are over. What am I gonna do?)
- Go home and rest.
	set {TestGroup.AfterSchoolOption} = "rest"
- Go home and flop down on my bed and snooze, maybe until the end of time.
	set {TestGroup.AfterSchoolOption} = "snooze"
- Go home and crash on the couch and wake up an indeterminate number of hours later.
	set {TestGroup.AfterSchoolOption} = "crash"
player: (Fuck it.)
player: (I'm too tired to do anything else, I'll figure out what I want to do later.)
leave player
And so our hero returns home to rest and make his plans for break some other time.

Doesn't anyone clean up after themselves any more?
